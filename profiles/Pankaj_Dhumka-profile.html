        <p>Dr Pankaj Dumka completed his B. Tech. from Indraprastha Engineering College Ghaziabad (affiliated to U.P.T.U) in Mechanical Engineering in the year 2007, M. Tech. from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in "Fluids and Thermal Sciences (Mechanical Engineering)" in 2010, and Ph.D. from Jaypee University of Engineering and Technology, Guna in "Solar water desalination" in 2021. His research involves:
            1. Fabrication of winglet inserted microchannels.
            2. Study of flow pattern and mixing phenomenon in microchannels.
            3. Confocal analysis of different objects as well as mixing in the twisted channel.
            4. Use of solar energy to desalinate brackish/salty water for potable water production with the help of conventional solar still and its modifications.
            He has published many research articles in reputed SCI, and SCOPUS indexed Journals. He has been working with this University since July 07, 2011.</p>
